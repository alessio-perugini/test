# test

A modern, generics based testing assertions library for Go.

### Overview

!! This package is experimental !!

Package `test` provides an opinionated, lightweight library for writing
test case assertions in Go.

There are no external dependencies.

The minimum Go version is go1.18.

### Influence

This library was made after a ~decade of using [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify),
quite possibly the most used library in the whole Go ecosystem. All credit of
inspiration belongs to those maintainers.

### Install

Use `go get` to grab the latest version of `test`.

```shell
go get -u github.com/hashicorp/test@latest
```
